      <google-codelab-step label="About the App" duration="0">
        <p>InstaHelp is an emergency contact mobile application that detects natural human responses to stressful situations.</p>
<p>Upon activation, InstaHelp can send a text message to the user&#39;s designated emergency contacts and attract the attention of nearby bystanders by playing a loud siren from the user&#39;s phone and blinking the user&#39;s phone&#39;s flashlight.</p>
<p>InstaHelp provides a faster and more discreet emergency contact solution by removing the dependence on proprietary activation phrases that users may not recall in their time of need and attackers may recognize as the user&#39;s attempt to call for help.</p>
<p>With InstaHelp, safety is our speciality.</p>

<p>Goal 3: Good Health &amp; Wellbeing</p>
<p>As an emergency contact solution, InstaHelp recognizes the importance of every second in your time of need. The sooner we call for help, the sooner help arrives. With our distress detection, we ensures healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.</p>
<p>Goal 5: Gender Equality and Women&#39;s Empowerment</p>
<p>Women are disproportionately vulnerable to instances of theft and/or violence. InstaHelp strives to empower all women and girls to feel safer knowing that we will always have their back wherever they are at all times.</p>
<p>Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities</p>
<p>911 in the United States, 112 in the European Union, and many more existing emergency telephone numbers already serve their respective locations. But for those without a reliable service, InstaHelp reduces the emergency contact inequality among countries.</p>
<p>Goal 11: Sustainable Cities</p>
<p>InstaHelp shines brightest in urban areas with plenty of people to come to your aid. Harnessing the nearby population to provide a personal emergency service for all of our users makes cities and human settlements safe.</p>

<p>Google Cloud</p>
<p>Google Cloud Platform is the foundation for all of our backend operations. From securing our API keys to handling our billing account, GCP has been great for quickly getting started with all the business and security aspects of InstaHelp.</p>
<p>Firebase</p>
<p>Firebase is the home of authentication and database management for InstaHelp. The provided Firebase UI packages for user authentication proved especially handy for integrating user accounts in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Flutter</p>
<p>All front-end mobile development took place in The Flutter SDK. To reach as wide of an audience as possible, InstaHelp needs to be available on all major mobile platforms. For that, nothing beats The Flutter SDK.</p>
<p>Google Maps Platform</p>
<p>Google Maps Platform will be the main focus of our future. We are ambitiously building the ability to see and send alerts to trusted nearby InstaHelp users with Google Maps Platform at our core.</p>
